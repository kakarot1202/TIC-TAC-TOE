_**# TIC-TAC-TOE**_
Pythonic Tic Tac Toe is a console-based implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe. It's written in Python and offers a simple yet engaging gameplay experience for two players.

_**Key Features:**_

1---  Console Interface: The game runs entirely in the console, providing a straightforward user interface where players can input their moves using the keyboard.
2---  Player vs Player: The game supports a two-player mode, where each player takes turns placing their respective symbols (X or O) on the board.
3---  Board Visualization: The current state of the game board is visually represented after each move, making it easy for players to see the progress of the game.
4---  Winning Conditions: The game detects winning conditions (three consecutive symbols in a row, column, or diagonal) and declares the winner once they're met.
5---  Draw Detection: If all cells on the board are filled and no player has won, the game recognizes a draw and ends the game accordingly.
6---  Error Handling: Robust error handling ensures that invalid moves or inputs are properly handled, providing feedback to the players and prompting them to make valid moves.
